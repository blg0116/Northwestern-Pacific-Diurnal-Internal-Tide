# Northwestern-Pacific-Diurnal-Internal-Tide
The dataset includes the data of the modelled K1 diurnal internal tide energy in the northwestern Pacific
The E_u* and E_v* variables represent the energy flux in the zonal and meridional directions, respectively.
The lon* and lat* variables represent the longitude and latitude coordinate.
The CR* indicates the depth-integrated barotropic to baroclinic energy conversion rate.
The Diss indicates the depth-integrated dissipation rates.
