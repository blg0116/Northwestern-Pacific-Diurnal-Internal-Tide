# Northwestern-Pacific-Diurnal-Internal-Tide
The dataset includes the data of the modelled K1 diurnal internal tide energy in the northwestern Pacific.
The Regional Ocean Modelling System (ROMS) is used.
The E_u* and E_v* variables represent the energy flux in the zonal and meridional directions, respectively.
The lon* and lat* variables represent the longitude and latitude coordinate.
The Diss indicates the depth-integrated dissipation rates.
The ssh* variables represent baroclinic ssh field of line-souce model.
The lon_ray* and lat_ray* indicate the ray-tracing patterns of the ray tracing model.
